  <title>Torque Exporter What's new</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Torque Exporter Plug in for Blender</h1>
<h2>What's New for version .91<br>
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Animation code rewritten.&nbsp; You can now create animations
using Inverse Kinematics (and other constraints) and export them
directly without needing to bake the actions first.&nbsp; It is highly
recommended that you use bones as your constraint targets rather than
empties.&nbsp; The constraint targets do not need to be exported.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Bug fixes for detail maps and material properties.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed exporter crash when the action containing the reference
pose for a blend animation is deleted.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The validity of the output path is now checked prior to
export.&nbsp; If the path is invalid (usually is for files that you
download from someone else), it is reset to the default path (the
folder containing your blend file).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that caused duplicate entries to be added to the
blend ref pose action pulldown when the sequence list was refreshed.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Re-enabled GUI refresh while dragging, now you can see where you
are dragging the GUI to in real time.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that was causing newly added detail levels and
collision meshes not to show up in the export until Blender was
restarted.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Collision meshes now ignore the double sided mesh flag, are
always single sided.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed an exporter crash that occured when the last Trigger for a
sequence was deleted.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that was causing trigger state values for exported
sequences to be incorrect.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Other small fixes and enhancements.</li>
</ul>
