  <title>Torque Exporter What's new</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Torque Exporter Plug in for Blender</h1>
<br>
<h2>What's New for version 0.94</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Animation export code updated to work with the Blender 2.43 (is
still compatible with Blender 2.42 as well).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Changed the bone grid control in the Armatures panel of the
exporter GUI into a scrollable list, and added wildcard matching to
turn bones on and off.&nbsp; Thanks go out to Todd&nbsp; Koeckeritz for
providing ideas and feedback for this.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Added a new "Geometry Type" section to the general tab to replace
the old "triangle strip" section.&nbsp; New buttons allow the user to
choose between exporting single triangles, triangle lists, and triangle
strips.&nbsp; Defaults to single triangles.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Better scrollbars in the exporter GUI, adjustments to the size of
the sequences list, changed coloring of sequence list items, and
general visual improvements all courtesy of Todd Koeckeritz.</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem with skinned meshes that caused a crash when
using a blender-exported dts in TGE as a static shape.&nbsp; Thanks go
out to Jari for finding and helping to diagnose the problem.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed erroneous collision mesh name console warning (must start
with "col") due to incorrect null mesh padding on visible detail level
objects.&nbsp; Thanks go out to Jari for finding the problem.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>What's New for version 0.93</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Added a Built-in triangle stripper&nbsp; "QADTriStripper" (Quick
and Dirty Triangle Stripper)</li>
  <li>VTK Triangle stripping is also tested and working now.</li>
  <li>New Changed mesh export code to allow multiple triangles all
belonging to the same material group to be stored inside a single
"Triangles" (triangle list) primitive. Previously the exporter was
storing each tri in a separate primitive, resulting in tons of unneeded
gl calls.</li>
  <li>Added Vincent BILLET's storeCheck fix that allows larger shapes
to be exported.</li>
  <li>Changed the way collision meshes are exported.&nbsp; They are now
packed into the first subshape along with everything else.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Added the ability to animate collision meshes.&nbsp; This is
accomplished by setting a "Copy Location" constraint on the mesh, with
an armature bone as a target.&nbsp; Make sure you are exporting the
constraint target bone or it won't work.&nbsp; Don't be surprised if
this doesn't work the way you want it to in Torque.&nbsp; The player
can collide with an animated mesh, but an animated mesh will not
collide with or push the player around.&nbsp; Play around with it
in-game before getting too fancy with it; you'll see what I mean.&nbsp;
Also, projectile collision with a mesh while it is animating is
unreliable.&nbsp; It seems to work OK once the mesh has stopped moving
though.&nbsp; Your millage may vary.</li>
  <li>Changed the way mesh normals are calculated, as per Alberto
Ganesh Barbati's suggestion.</li>
  <li>Fixed an exporter crash when exporting a mesh object with no
vertices.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that would under some conditions cause duplicate
objects to be exported.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in appendVertex that was causing incorrect geometry
to be exported.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that caused animated rigid meshes to have incorrect
offsets from their parent bones</li>
  <li>Fixed a small bug when writing exception tracebacks to the log
that manifests when a full version of python is not available</li>
  <li>Other small fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's New for version 0.92</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed broken animation export in Blender 2.42</li>
  <li>Added an updated version of Alberto Ganesh Barbati's set
smooth/set solid fix based on discussion in this thread:
http://www.garagegames.com/mg/forums/result.thread.php?qt=52384</li>
  <li>Bug fixes for ground frames</li>
  <li>The bounds mesh can now be animated by parenting it directly to a
bone.&nbsp; This allows much easier export of shapes with multiple
animations that must use ground frames.</li>
  <li>Added code to allow rigid mesh attachment to a node by parenting
a mesh directly to a blender bone.&nbsp; This performs better in TGE
and opengl in general if you don't need mesh deformations (for things
like machines, doors, vehicles, etc.)</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that caused the exporter to crash under blender 2.42
when exporting an animation with a constraint influence channel.</li>
  <li>Added code that causes the exporter to dump the traceback to the
export log if an exception is thrown (courtesy of Alberto Ganesh
Barbati)</li>
  <li>Optimized hotspots in the exporter code for speed, export should
be somewhat faster now for a wide range of models.</li>
  <li>Fixed a crash bug when exporting a mesh with an empty material
slot.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Other small fixes and enhancements<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>What's New for version 0.91<br>
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Animation code rewritten.&nbsp; You can now create animations
using Inverse Kinematics (and other constraints) and export them
directly without needing to bake the actions first.&nbsp; It is highly
recommended that you use bones as your constraint targets rather than
empties.&nbsp; The constraint targets do not need to be exported.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Bug fixes for detail maps and material properties.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed exporter crash when the action containing the reference
pose for a blend animation is deleted.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The validity of the output path is now checked prior to
export.&nbsp; If the path is invalid (usually is for files that you
download from someone else), it is reset to the default path (the
folder containing your blend file).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that caused duplicate entries to be added to the
blend ref pose action pulldown when the sequence list was refreshed.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Re-enabled GUI refresh while dragging, now you can see where you
are dragging the GUI to in real time.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that was causing newly added detail levels and
collision meshes not to show up in the export until Blender was
restarted.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Collision meshes now ignore the double sided mesh flag, are
always single sided.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed an exporter crash that occured when the last Trigger for a
sequence was deleted.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that was causing trigger state values for exported
sequences to be incorrect.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Other small fixes and enhancements.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's New for version 0.90<br>
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Blender 2.40 Compatibility, courtesy of Joseph Greenawalt, with
preliminary work done by Todd Koeckeritz.</li>
  <li>Level of Detail system rewrite, courtesy of James Urquhart.&nbsp;
Exported LODs work in the stock Torque Game Engine now without code
changes.</li>
  <li>Installer Scripts for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux, courtesy of
James Urquhart.</li>
  <li>Preliminary TSE material script support courtesy of&nbsp; James
Urquhart.</li>
  <li>Added the ability to choose output folder and file name for the
exported dts, courtesy of&nbsp; James Urquhart.</li>
  <li>Revamped GUI Courtesy of James Urquhart and Xen Amado, with
additional bug fixes by Joseph Greenawalt.</li>
  <li>Improved support for Blend animations by Joseph Greenawalt.</li>
  <li>Fixed armature transforms.&nbsp; Armatures can now be rotated,
scaled and translated in object mode without causing problems with the
exported dts. It is no longer necessary to apply size/rotation to your
armatures.&nbsp; Courtesy of Joseph Greenawalt.</li>
  <li>Fixed transforms on unparented bones.&nbsp; Animations of
unparented bones now work correctly without using the "dummy bone"
trick, courtesy of Joseph Greenawalt.</li>
  <li>Numerous other small fixes and enhancements.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
